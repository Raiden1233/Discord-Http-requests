> ### That's all you have to do with browser developer mode you can close it now since we don't need it anymore.

> [!NOTE]
> Now before doing next step i want you to turn on the developer mode, if you don't know how just go in the discord `settings` -> then scroll down to find `Advanced` here you'll see Developer mode enable it, it would ask you to restart discord so just do it.

> when you are done with that, now you have to go back to the same person's dms that you opened along with browser developer mode. We now need to copy the `channel id` and `user id` to copy the channel id you just have to right click on that persons dms then you'll see `copy channel id` on the bottom just click on it and then past it into `information.txt` then just above it you'd see `copy user id` click on it as well and past it into `information.txt` as well.

> When you are done with it your `information.txt` should contain information like this, if it already contain information just delete those and use the one you copied.

# Now enjoy
> Just run the scrip now open the terminal inside the folder in which you have the scripts insteald or in vscode ( either way you have to locate the files) if you want, if in terminal type the comman `python send.py` and `python recieve_text.py` remember you have to type each command in one specific terminal and if you are going to run through vscode just run it normally with the run icon on the top right ( i mean if you have vs code you'd know what to do lol )
